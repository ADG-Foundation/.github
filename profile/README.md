# ADG Foundation (Working Group on Automated Deduction in Geometry)

This is the official GitHub repository of [ADG Foundation](https://adg-foundation.info).

## The ADG Library

ADG Foundation maintains a library to provide rigorous descriptions of the
axiom systems used by the different geometry automatic and interactive theorem provers,
propose common input and output languages for geometry theorem provers, and
establish and make available to the research community a large library
of geometric problems.

The [ADG Library](https://github.com/ADG-Foundation/ADG-Lib) is an initiative
started by ADG Foundation members Pedro Quaresma, Predrag Janičić, Julien Narboux,
Zoltán Kovács, Anna Petiurenko, Filip Marić, and Nuno Baeta. It is currently
a work in progress.

## Provers supported by ADG

ADG Foundation regularly examines, discusses and evaluates high quality
computer software to study automated deduction in geometry. In our main focus
are the following software, but this list can be extended in the future.
Most importantly, the pieces of software listed here are supported in
the ADG Library by considering them de facto standards and providing
importers and exporters for them:

* [GCLC](https://poincare.matf.bg.ac.rs/~janicic/gclc/), "Geometry Constructions -> LaTeX Converter",
  a tool for visualizing geometry, and for producing mathematical illustrations,
  extended with the help of automated theorem provers.
* [Java Geometry Expert](https://github.com/ADG-Foundation/Java-Geometry-Expert),
  a graphical tool to study proofs of geometry theorems in Euclidean geometry.
  We store a stable version of the
  [currently maintained fork](https://github.com/kovzol/Java-Geometry-Expert) and are looking
  forward to releasing new versions on this page. Also, we suggest trying
  an [online version](https://matek.hu/zoltan/jgex-cheerpj) powered by CheerpJ.
* [GeoGebra Discovery](https://github.com/ADG-Foundation/geogebra-discovery) is a fork
  of an [experimental version](https://github.com/kovzol/geogebra-discovery) of the
  dynamic mathematics software [GeoGebra](https://www.geogebra.org). It allows the user
  to study proofs with various methods.
